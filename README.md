# DrAwesome4333.github.io

This is a site to showcase some of the projects I am working on that I feel are interesting. Most are single web-page applications of some sort. Various pages have had many versions or have been worked on/revised for a long time (before they were added here). Feel free to use the code demonstrated at this site and also give credit to the original writer where you use it and also provide the same rights to the code used to others as given you when using this code (see the license)! 

A redesign of how index.html works is underway, it was put together quickly when there were only 2 or 3 pages on there. I plan on learning more desgin tricks (CSS is not my forte) to make it nicer and more organized in the future as I add more projects and will hopefully be able to add a brief description and history of each one, they all have a story!

A lot more stuff will be added, both current and past projects I have done once I get the homepage thing sorted out (a long list of links is not very easy on the eyes).
